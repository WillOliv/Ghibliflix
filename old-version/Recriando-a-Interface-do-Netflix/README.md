This version was made at a bootcamp on Digital Innovation One Website in march/april 2021

The assignment was "recreate the Netflix homepage with the theme of your choice".
Then i decided to make one with a Studio Ghibli's theme, putting all movies in there.

Was my first "big project" and was the most satisfying project that i've made.
2 years later i started studying WEB Development more deeply and tried to recreate this project again as a practical test.

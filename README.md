# **GHIBLIFLIX**

## Description
- This project is a Netflix Homepage recreation but themed with Studio Ghibli movies;
- It was a assignment in a Bootcamp that I made at [Digital Innovation One](https://web.dio.me/home) (DIO);
- It was made in 2021 and was my fisrt "big project";
- Now in 2023, I started to study WEB Development more deeply, so I tried to make it once again as a "warm up project" to remember the basics sintaxes of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
